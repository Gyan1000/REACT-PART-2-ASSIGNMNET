# Project Title

# DYNAMIC BUTTONS

### Description

I have Developed a web applicaaion using React that funcaions as a counter. It includes two buttons in the UI.
Implement the counter logic using React's state management.I used appropriate React components and hooks to manage the counter state and handle button click events.

## Features

- There are two buttons 
  #### increment:
  On clicking this button, the counter value should be incremented by one.

  #### decrement:  
   On clicking this button, the counter value should be decremented by one.

- Counter value is displayed in the UI and updates in real-time when incremented or
  decremented.

- Fully responsive
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform
