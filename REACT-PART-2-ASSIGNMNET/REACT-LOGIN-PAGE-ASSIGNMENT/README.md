# Project Title

# Instagram Login Page

### Description

In this project, I have created a user page similar to Instagram using React functionalities. The primary task
of this project is to implement conditional rendering, allowing users to either sign up or log in depending on their choice. 


## Features

- The user interface showed different input fields based on their selection. If they choose to sign up, additional
  inputs for registration will be displayed

-  On the other hand, if they opt for login, only the basic username and
   password inputs will be visible.
   
- Fully responsive
- Fullscreen mode
- Cross platform


## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://link-to-project
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd type your project's name
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
  
   react ,
   react-dom
   
```

Start the server

```bash
npm start
  
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
```
